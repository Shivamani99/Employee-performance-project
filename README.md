üìä Employee Performance Mapping - MySQL Project
üìå Project Overview
This project, Employee Performance Mapping, was completed as part of the SQL Training Course-End Project. The goal was to help ScienceQtech, a data science startup, analyze and evaluate employee performance using a relational database approach in MySQL.

üß† Problem Statement
ScienceQtech needs a system to analyze employee performance during their annual appraisal cycle. As a Junior Database Administrator (DBA), your job is to extract key insights from the employee and project data, calculate bonuses, evaluate job standards, and assist HR with data-driven decision-making.

üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Description
Three datasets were used:

1. emp_record_table.csv
Details of all employees:

EMP_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, GENDER, ROLE, DEPT, EXP, COUNTRY, CONTINENT, SALARY, EMP_RATING, MANAGER_ID, PROJ_ID

2. proj_table.csv
Information about all projects:

PROJECT_ID, PROJ_NAME, DOMAIN, START_DATE, CLOSURE_DATE, DEV_QTR, STATUS

3. data_science_team.csv
Employees in the data science team:

EMP_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, GENDER, ROLE, DEPT, EXP, COUNTRY, CONTINENT

‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
Create Database:

sql
